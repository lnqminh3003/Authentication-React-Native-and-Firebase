# Authentication-React-Native-and-Firebase
Authentication using React Native (Typescript, Expo, React Navigation, Redux for state management) and Firebase REST API

# First you clone this project
Run `npm install`

Run `npx expo start` to start the project in your Simulator

# Important note (.env file)
Get your `API_KEY` in Firebase project.

In this project, I actually commit `.env` file for you to replace the `API_KEY` easily in `.env` file. 

Your task is putting `.env` file in `.gitignore`.
